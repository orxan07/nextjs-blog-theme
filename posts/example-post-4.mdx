Mental models are frameworks people create in their minds to understand how something should work. They’re the expectations users carry with them when they encounter a new app, website, or product. For example, a user expects that clicking on a logo will take them back to the homepage, or that clicking a shopping cart icon will show them a list of items they’ve added.

Mental models vary from user to user, depending on factors like cultural background, experience level, and personal habits. However, successful designs usually align with widely shared expectations, allowing for intuitive interactions.
